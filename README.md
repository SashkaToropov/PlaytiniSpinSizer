# PlaytiniSpinSizer

PlaytiniSpinSizer is an iOS game developed in Swift using UIKit. The game features a rotating circle at the center of the screen and two horizontal obstacles moving from right to left. 

## Features
- The game has a rotating circle at the center of the screen.
- The size of the circle can be increased or decreased by tapping on "+" and "-" buttons respectively.
- Two horizontal obstacles move from the right side of the screen to the left at random heights.
- When the rotating circle collides with an obstacle, the device vibrates.
- The number of collisions is tracked and displayed on the screen.
- After 5 collisions, an alert is shown, asking the user if they want to restart the game.

## Implementation
- The game interface is created using UIKit.
- The rotating animation of the circle is implemented using UIView.animate function.
- A Timer is used to constantly check for collisions between the circle and the obstacles.
- The obstacles' movement across the screen is done using UIViewPropertyAnimator.
